## About
Aspiring Data Analyst | Passionate About Turning Data into Actionable Insights

Driven by a passion for uncovering meaningful insights through data, I am a results-oriented Junior Data Analyst with a strong analytical mindset and a background in teaching. My journey into data analytics was sparked by a deep curiosity for problem-solving and the impact of data-driven decision-making in today’s fast-paced business world.

With 4+ years of experience in education, I developed a keen ability to break down complex concepts, a skill that translates seamlessly into analyzing large datasets, identifying trends, and presenting insights in a clear and impactful way. Proficient in SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, I have hands-on experience in data visualization, ETL processes, and building dashboards that drive strategic decision-making.

My recent completion of the Generation Data Analytics Program has equipped me with advanced skills in statistical analysis, data wrangling, and business intelligence tools. Throughout the program, I particularly enjoyed working on real-world projects, where I applied data storytelling techniques to transform raw data into compelling narratives that influence business strategies.

I thrive in collaborative environments, whether remote or in-person, and take a structured approach to problem-solving—combining analytical thinking with creativity to develop efficient and scalable solutions. I am eager to bring this skill set to an organization that values innovation, continuous learning, and data-driven transformation.

I am particularly interested in joining a work environment with data-driven and growth-impacting culture,  because of its reputation for leveraging data to drive meaningful change. I admire its commitment toturning data into actionable insights, ensuring data integrity, continuous learning, problem-solving, and driving business impact through data-driven decision-making, and I see this role as an opportunity to contribute to impactful projects while further honing my expertise in data analytics.

Looking ahead, I aim to specialize in business intelligence and predictive analytics, with the goal of optimizing processes and enhancing decision-making within organizations. I am committed to continuous growth, regularly expanding my knowledge through online courses, data challenges, and personal projects.
I am excited about the possibility of joining a forward-thinking team where I can apply my analytical skills, drive efficiency, and make data more accessible and actionable for key stakeholders.

Let’s connect and explore how I can contribute to your team’s success!

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### **Academic Performance Dashboard – Project Overview**
**Code:** [`Academic Performance Dashboard – Project Overview`](https://github.com/Top-BenBen/PortfolioProjects/tree/05ba98cd29727daaf59f9e17e67603e2c4da7b46)  

**Goal:**  
The objective of this dashboard is to provide a comprehensive analysis of student performance, helping educators and administrators identify key trends, strengths, and areas for improvement. By leveraging data-driven insights, this tool supports informed decision-making to enhance academic outcomes.  

**Description**:
This interactive dashboard, built using Microsoft Excel, consolidates various academic metrics into a visually intuitive format. It presents subject-wise average scores, gender-based performance comparisons, pass rates, score distributions, and the correlation between attendance and performance. The dashboard enables educators to track progress, address disparities, and implement targeted interventions to improve student success rates.  

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
  **Data Analysis:** Extracting, processing, and interpreting student performance data to uncover meaningful insights.  
  **Data Visualization:** Designing dynamic charts and graphs to present information in a clear and actionable manner.  
  **Dashboard Design:** Structuring data elements effectively to enhance readability and user experience.  
  **Problem-Solving:** Identifying performance gaps and suggesting strategies for improvement.  
  **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Ensuring accuracy by refining and organizing raw data.  

**Technology Used:**  
  **Microsoft Excel:** Pivot tables, conditional formatting, and advanced formulas to process and analyze data.  
  **Data Visualization Tools:** Bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and score distributions for effective storytelling.  
  **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Processes:** Cleaning and transforming data for seamless analysis.  

**Result:**  
The dashboard provides educators with a data-driven approach to monitoring academic performance. By identifying underperforming subjects, assessing gender disparities, and analyzing attendance impact, it enables targeted interventions. The structured visualization ensures quick interpretation, facilitating proactive measures to enhance student outcomes and optimize teaching strategies.
