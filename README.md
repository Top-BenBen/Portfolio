# Bernard Doyi - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Bernard! I am a results-driven Junior Data Analyst with 4+ years of teaching experience, bringing a strong analytical mindset and a passion for data-driven decision-making. Proficient in Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau, with hands-on experience analyzing large datasets to improve operational efficiency and create impactful visualizations. Skilled in collaborating in remote and in-person environments, ensuring high-quality project delivery on schedule. Adept at leveraging data to optimize processes, drive innovation, and foster productive stakeholder relationships.  

My journey into data analytics began in education, where my experience as a teacher honed my ability to break down complex information, identify patterns, and communicate insights effectively. Through the Generation programme, I deepened my expertise in ETL processes, data visualization, and dashboard development, refining my ability to translate raw data into actionable insights.  

I am committed to continuous learning, regularly exploring new BI tools, participating in data challenges, and staying updated with industry trends. In my next role, I aim to refine my expertise in advanced data modeling, automation, and predictive analytics, ensuring that I add tangible value to the organization. My ability to manage multiple priorities, adapt quickly, and seek innovative solutions makes me a valuable addition to any team. I am eager to embark on this journey and make a meaningful impact through data.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### **Academic Performance Dashboard – Project Overview**
**Code:** [`Academic Performance Dashboard – Project Overview.ipynb`](PUT LINK)  

**Goal:**  
The objective of this dashboard is to provide a comprehensive analysis of student performance, helping educators and administrators identify key trends, strengths, and areas for improvement. By leveraging data-driven insights, this tool supports informed decision-making to enhance academic outcomes.  

**Description**:
This interactive dashboard, built using Microsoft Excel, consolidates various academic metrics into a visually intuitive format. It presents subject-wise average scores, gender-based performance comparisons, pass rates, score distributions, and the correlation between attendance and performance. The dashboard enables educators to track progress, address disparities, and implement targeted interventions to improve student success rates.  

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
  **Data Analysis:** Extracting, processing, and interpreting student performance data to uncover meaningful insights.  
  **Data Visualization:** Designing dynamic charts and graphs to present information in a clear and actionable manner.  
  **Dashboard Design:** Structuring data elements effectively to enhance readability and user experience.  
  **Problem-Solving:** Identifying performance gaps and suggesting strategies for improvement.  
  **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Ensuring accuracy by refining and organizing raw data.  

**Technology Used:**  
  **Microsoft Excel:** Pivot tables, conditional formatting, and advanced formulas to process and analyze data.  
  **Data Visualization Tools:** Bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and score distributions for effective storytelling.  
  **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Processes:** Cleaning and transforming data for seamless analysis.  

**Result:**  
The dashboard provides educators with a data-driven approach to monitoring academic performance. By identifying underperforming subjects, assessing gender disparities, and analyzing attendance impact, it enables targeted interventions. The structured visualization ensures quick interpretation, facilitating proactive measures to enhance student outcomes and optimize teaching strategies.  

This project showcases strong expertise in Excel-based analytics, demonstrating the ability to transform complex datasets into actionable insights that drive meaningful improvements.

### Tech Store Sales Analysis

**Goal:** To examine the sales history of the store and extract insights on its performance, as well as to identify potential improvements that can be implemented.

**Code:** [`Tech Store Sales Analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Tech%20Store%20Sales%20Analysis.ipynb)

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of sales records.  The records include the products for sale and order information(order id, order date, price, quantity ordered and purchase address). The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing sales data and hypothesis testing.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.

**Results:** Python functions that calculated and visually presented the sales data by month, city, and the most commonly sold items. Additionally, the reasons for the high frequency of these items being sold were analyzed and provided as insights.
